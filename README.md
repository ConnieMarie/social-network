# Social Network API

  [![License: ISC](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-ISC-blue.svg)](#license)

  ## Description
  This API was built for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friends list. I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. Below you will find a walkthrough video demonstrating its functionality as well as information relative to the table of contents.
